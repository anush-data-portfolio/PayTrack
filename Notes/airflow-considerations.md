# Practices followed for Using Apache Airflow

## General Guidelines:

1. **Airflow as an Orchestrator, Not an Executor:**
   - Airflow is designed as an orchestrator, not an executor. It coordinates and manages workflows but delegates task execution to external executors.

2. **Branching in Airflow:**
   - Utilize the `BranchPythonOperator` to handle branching in workflows.
   - Helpful resources on pitfalls and solutions for the BranchPythonOperator:

      - [Vivek Jadhav's Medium Post](https://vivekjadhavr.medium.com/how-can-airflows-branch-operator-solve-your-workflow-branching-problems-a4f1cda95f71)

3. **Beyond Cron:**
   - Understand key concepts of Apache Airflow, moving beyond traditional cron jobs.
   - Key articles for a deeper understanding:

## Reasons to Choose Airflow Over Cron:

1. **Handling Task Dependencies:**
   - Airflow provides a robust mechanism for defining and managing dependencies between tasks in a workflow.

2. **Retry Mechanism:**
   - Unlike cron, Airflow includes a built-in retry mechanism for tasks, ensuring reliability in case of transient failures.

3. **Error Traceability:**
   - Airflow offers enhanced traceability of errors through detailed logs, making it easier to identify and troubleshoot issues.

4. **Monitoring:**
   - Airflow provides comprehensive monitoring capabilities, allowing users to track the progress and performance of workflows in real-time.

5. **Simplified Design:**
   - Airflow simplifies workflow design, making it easier to express complex dependencies and relationships between tasks.

In summary, Apache Airflow goes beyond the limitations of cron by providing a flexible and powerful framework for orchestrating workflows with better dependency management, error handling, monitoring, and a more intuitive design.
