# Data Engineering Project - Personal Work Hours Tracking and Visualization

## Project Overview

This data engineering project is designed to assist me, a graduate student working part-time in order to make some extra spending cash and save for the future. 
My college provides a website where employees can access their work-hour data. However, the information available on the website is limited to date, clock-in time, and clock-out time. To gain more insights and effectively manage my work hours, I decided to create a solution that extracts, stores and visualizes this data.

## Project Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

1. **Data Extraction**: Develop a data extraction process to collect my work hours data from the Kronos website using its API.

2. **Data Storage**: Create and maintain a relational database to store the extracted data securely.

3. **Data Transformation**: Implement necessary data transformations to ensure data consistency and accuracy. This may include data cleaning, validation, and standardization.

4. **Dashboard Creation**: Generate a dashboard using Notion to visualize my work hours data, providing me with an easy-to-read summary.

## Project Components

The project comprises the following components:

### 1. Data Extraction

A script or program is developed to interact with the API that is used to populate the website and extract my work hours data, including date, clock-in time, and clock-out time.

### 2. Database Management

A relational database is created to store my extracted data. This database may consist of one or more tables representing the different aspects of my work hours data. This component is responsible for maintaining data integrity.

### 3. Data Transformation

Data transformation procedures are implemented to clean, validate, and standardize the extracted data, ensuring that it is ready for visualization.

### 4. Dashboard Generation

A Notion dashboard is generated to display my work hours data. This dashboard will provide insights into work hours trends, hours worked, and any other relevant metrics.


## Project Benefits

This data engineering project offers the following benefits:

- Efficiently tracks my work hours.
- Provides data visualization for better insights.
- Facilitates better management of my part-time work.
